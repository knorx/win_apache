# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Release 0.1.0

0.1.0 Was just about getting it out here.  All of the basic functionality to get it installed and configured.

0.1.1 Updating the README file to give proper information.

0.1.2 Updated README to remove win_mysql reference, because this is wn_apache.  That's what I get for copying and pasting sometimes.
